## How to create an input file for the matching algorithm:

Provide the following fields: data_directory, graphics_directory, data_export_directory, sample_names, sample_sequences, nicking_pos, sample_files, secondary_sequences, secondary_nicking_pos
* data_directory: Directory path where the raw data is saved
* graphics_directory: Directory where graphics are will be saved to
* data_export_directory: Directory where processed data will be saved to
* sample_names: Names of you samples
* sample_sequences: DNA sequence of one strand of your DNA (5'->3' direction)
* nicking_pos: Center position of your strand, not nessessarly an integer 
* sample_files: File names of the data samples within the data_directory
* secondary_sequences, secondary_nicking_pos: Same as sample_sequences and nicking_pos but for the complementary strand
 
Write each of the fields in a separate line in the shape key value_1 value_2 value_3 ... value_n only seperated by spaces (don't use any extra spaces in file names etc.)
All directory names need to end with "/". For paired-end sequencing make sure that the paired files only differ in "R1" and "R2"!
